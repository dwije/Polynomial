# Polynomial
Rutgers University - Data Structures Programming Assignment

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program that can accept and manipulate polynomials and operate on them.
The primary data structure used was singly-linked linked lists, as defined in the Node class.
Each node contains a Term object (which in turn contains a float coefficient and integer degree), as well as the next Node.

Polynomial.java is the driving class of the program, containing two major methods: add and multiply.
The add method takes two Node objects as inputs, each one containing the head of the polynomial linked list.
